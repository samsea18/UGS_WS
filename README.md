# Web Science (H) Course Work - Event Detection
Developed python web-crawlers using Twitter and Reddit APIs to conduct event detection (Trending events and topics) in Singapore.
Harvested data was stored in MongoDB and extracted later for analysis (peak online traffic & trending topics) using various visualization techniques (Histogram, Word Cloud & Heatmap) through Jupyter Notebook.

This is a course work on Event Detection. The repository consists of 2 folders:
- Report
- Scripts

The Script folder contains two sub-folders for Twitter and Reddit analytics respectively. 

Each sub-folder consists of:
- A crawler.py script
- An analytics.ipynb
- Exported MongoDB file (.json)

For twitter_crawler.py and reddit_crawler.py :
1) Open cmd
2) cd directory
3) python file_name.py 

For twitter_analytics.ipynb and reddit_analytics.ipynb :
1) Install Jupyter
2) Select file via interface
3) Run each segment with SHIFT + ENTER
